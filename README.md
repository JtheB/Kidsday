**Kidsday** is a social project in the German city Karlsruhe, which provides kids with a free day full of games and a tasty meal.
I'm currently reworking the website, because the [old design] (http://kidsday-karlsruhe.de/) is quite antique and not from me.
This is the second design including the coporate design of [Nehemia e.V.] (http://nehemia-initiative.de/)
